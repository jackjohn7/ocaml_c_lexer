# OCaml C Lexer

In preparation for future language development, I've decided
to try reimplementing my C lexer written in SML in OCaml.
I remembered that OCaml had some nicer features for pattern
matching and I plan on making use of that in the future.

This was done to bring myself back up to speed.
